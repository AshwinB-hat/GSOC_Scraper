#GSOC scraper 

This project is mainly made with the intention to track the recurring organisations in GSOC. 


It initially scrapes the web and then stores the organisation details in a dataframe. 

This dataframe is then processed on to find the recurring organisations grouped year wise and then it prints the name of the organisations.
